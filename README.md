# 🧠 Multi-Agent AI System for Retail Inventory Optimization

A modular, intelligent system that leverages multiple AI agents to collaboratively solve core retail challenges: demand forecasting, inventory monitoring, pricing optimization, and supplier coordination. The goal is to maintain stock availability, reduce holding costs, and boost supply chain efficiency.

## 🚀 Problem Statement

Retail businesses face constant challenges in maintaining optimal inventory levels. Stockouts lead to lost sales, while overstocking increases holding costs. Traditional systems rely heavily on manual forecasting and pricing decisions. This project proposes a Multi-Agent AI framework that enables stores, warehouses, and suppliers to collaborate autonomously and proactively manage inventory.

## 🔍 Proposed Solution Overview

We designed a Multi-Agent System where intelligent agents perform:
- 📈 Demand Forecasting
- 📦 Inventory Monitoring
- 💰 Pricing Optimization
- 🚛 Supplier Coordination

A central Coordinator Agent oversees data flow and decision synchronization between agents. Machine learning models and rule-based logic are used for forecasting, restocking, and price adjustments. The architecture is scalable and supports real-time decisions.

## 🧠 Agent Roles & Interactions

- DemandForecastingAgent: Predicts future product demand using ML models.
- InventoryMonitoringAgent: Tracks stock levels, triggers restock if under reorder point.
- PricingOptimizationAgent: Dynamically updates product prices based on elasticity and demand.
- SupplierAgent: Processes restocking requests and updates delivery status.
- CoordinatorAgent: Central controller managing agent communication and operation cycles.

🔍 Interaction Flow:
forecast → check inventory → reorder if needed → adjust price → update system
